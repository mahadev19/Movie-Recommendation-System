üé¨ Movie Recommendation System

This project aims to create a recommendation engine that suggests movies based on user preferences, previous ratings, or other similarity metrics. It showcases skills in Python programming, data science, and machine learning algorithms like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

üîç About the Project

This is a 5th-semester project aimed at building a movie recommendation system that helps users discover new movies. The system leverages machine learning models to suggest relevant movies based on user interactions or movie metadata (like genres, cast, etc.).

It includes:

Content Based Recommendation System: 
It uses attributes such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make suggestions for the users. 
The intuition behind this sort of recommendation system is that if a user liked a particular movie or show, he might like a movie or a show similar to it.

Database Connectivity

In this project we used two dataset i.e

‚Äòtmdb_5000_movies.csv‚Äô

‚Äòtmdb_5000_credits.csv‚Äô 

That contains all details of movies like id, title, genres, budget, cast, keywords etc. 

With the use of jupyter notebook we build our project model and performed data operations and machine learning algorithms 

Language used in this project-:

In this project, the primary programming language used is Python, along with the Flask web framework for building the web application. Python is a versatile and widely-used language known for its simplicity and readability, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.

Flask is a lightweight and easy-to-use web framework that simplifies the process of building web applications in Python. It provides essential tools for handling HTTP requests, managing routes, and rendering dynamic content.

HTML and CSS: Standard web development languages used for creating the user interface and styling the web pages.

To develop this  project we used following algorithms.

Count Vectorization: Count Vectorization is a text processing technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. It involves representing a document as a vector, where each element of the vector corresponds to the frequency of a particular word in the document. This process is also known as "Bag of Words" representation.

Cosine similarity: Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between two vectors, particularly in the context of information retrieval, text analysis, and recommendation systems. It is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.
